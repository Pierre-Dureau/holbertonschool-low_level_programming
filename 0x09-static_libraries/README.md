# 0x09. C - Static libraries

## Learning Objectives

### General
	What is recursion
	How to implement recursion
	In what situations you should implement recursion
	In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

## Tasks

### 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions
### 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
### 2. Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing
Write a blog post on C static libraries. It should cover:

* Why use libraries
* How they work
* How to create them
* How to use them
